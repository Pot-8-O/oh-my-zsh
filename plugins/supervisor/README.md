# supervisor plugin

This plugin adds tab-completion for `supervisord`/`supervisorctl` in [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/).
Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number
of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

To use it, add `supervisor` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:
